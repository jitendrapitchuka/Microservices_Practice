# Microservices Practice

This project demonstrates the practice of **Spring Boot Microservices**. The application consists of multiple microservices, with the use of a **service registry**, **API Gateway** for routing, **circuit breakers**, and **Micrometer** and **Zipkin** for distributed tracing.


## Project Structure

- **Microservice 1**: Exposed via API Gateway endpoint `http://localhost:8080/apiOne/getByAge/{age}`
- **Microservice 2**: Exposed via API Gateway endpoint `http://localhost:8080/apiTwo/test/{age}`

## Distributed Tracing with Micrometer & Zipkin

This project integrates **Micrometer** for metrics collection and **Zipkin** for distributed tracing.

### Starting Zipkin

To run Zipkin in Docker, use the following command:

```bash
docker run -d -p 9411:9411 openzipkin/zipkin
```

# Kafka Integration with Microservices

**Kafka Producer** is implemented in **Microservice 1**.  
**Kafka Consumer** is implemented in **Microservice 2**.

steps to up the docker compose file for kafka placed in deployment parent folder :
```bash
1)docker compose -f docker-compose.yml up
```
```bash
2)docker network create kafka-network
```
```bash
3)docker run -d --name zookeeper --network kafka-network -e ZOOKEEPER_CLIENT_PORT=2181 confluentinc/cp-zookeeper:latest
```
```bash
4)docker run -d --name kafka --network kafka-network -e KAFKA_ZOOKEEPER_CONNECT=zookeeper:2181 -e KAFKA_ADVERTISED_LISTENERS=PLAINTEXT://localhost:9092 -e KAFKA_BROKER_ID=1 -e KAFKA_OFFSETS_TOPIC_REPLICATION_FACTOR=1 confluentinc/cp-kafka:latest
```

### Redis Implementation (Redis-Practise Module)

1. **Start Redis container**:
    ```bash
    docker run --name my-redis -p 6379:6379 -d redis
    ```

2. **Access Redis CLI**:
    ```bash
    docker exec -it my-redis sh
    ```

3. **In Redis CLI**:
    ```bash
    redis-cli
    keys product:*
    FLUSHDB
    keys GetProduct:*
    ```

In the **Product Service**, I have implemented caching. The first time a product is fetched using its ID, it will take around 10 seconds (due to a simulated delay). However, subsequent fetches for the same product will be much faster because the result is cached in Redis.



## Prometheus ,Grafana , Loki Implementations

### 1. Start Docker Compose for Grafana and Prometheus

Navigate to the monitoring folder and run the following command to start the services:

   ```bash
   docker-compose up -d
   ```

### 2. Access Prometheus and Grafana

You can access Prometheus ,Grafana and Loki through the following ports:

- **Prometheus**: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090)
- **Grafana**: [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000)
- **Loki**: [http://localhost:3100/metrics](http://localhost:3100/metrics)

### 3. Make sure to replace `localhost` with your server's IP address in prometheus.yml file in monitoring folder

### 4. Added the necessary data sources for both Prometheus and Loki in Grafana to view the metrics and logs.

## üöÄ Elasticsearch Implementation (Redis-Practice Module)

This module demonstrates how to integrate **Elasticsearch** into a Spring Boot application using a **single-node cluster** setup via Docker.

### üì¶ Setup Elasticsearch with Docker

To set up a local **Elasticsearch** instance using Docker, follow the official guide:

üîó [Elasticsearch Docker Setup - Official Guide](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/install-elasticsearch-docker-basic)

### üìù Important Note

- When defining an `id` in the entity class, it‚Äôs recommended to use a **String** data type instead of **int**. This is because Elasticsearch will automatically create an ID for the document if the `id` field is left as a String.
- You can view all the stored indices by visiting the following URL in your browser:
[https://localhost:9200/person/_search?pretty&q=*:*](
https://localhost:9200/person/_search?pretty&q=*:*)

---

## üìã Code Example

### Entity Class (Person)

In your `Person` class, use the `@Document` annotation to define the Elasticsearch index and map the fields.

```java
@Document(indexName = "person")
@Getter
@Setter
@AllArgsConstructor
@NoArgsConstructor
@ToString
public class Person {

    @Id
    private String id; // Use String for id to let Elasticsearch auto-generate it
    private String name;
    private String email;

}
```
Sample Json output of all stored values in elastic and we can see below the autogenerated id values.

```json
{
    "content": [
       
        {
            "id": "dGJ9xZYBZpmfKikCjXbz",
            "name": "jitendra",
            "email": "=jitendra@email.com"
        },
        {
            "id": "dWJ9xZYBZpmfKikCvXYU",
            "name": "chinna",
            "email": "chinna@email.com"
        }
    ]
```
### üóÑÔ∏è Dual Database Strategy

- **Person**: Stored in MySQL
- **PersonElastic**: Stored in Elasticsearch

 When saving a record, persist it in both databases.However all search operations are performed only on the `PersonElastic` entity in Elasticsearch.

### üìä Kibana Setup for Elasticsearch (Docker)

To run **Kibana** with Elasticsearch using Docker, follow the official guide:  
[Install Kibana with Docker - Elastic Docs](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/install-kibana-with-docker)

#### üöÄ Quick Start

1. **Start Elasticsearch and Kibana containers**  
   Follow the steps in the [official guide](https://www.elastic.co/docs/deploy-manage/deploy/self-managed/install-kibana-with-docker) to get both services running.

2. **Access Kibana**  
   - Open your browser and navigate to:  
     ```
     http://localhost:5601
     ```
   - When prompted, enter the **enrollment token** and the `elastic` username and password generated by Elasticsearch.


#### üóÇÔ∏è Create a Data View

After logging in:

1. **Create a Data View**  
   - Go to **Management** ‚Üí **Stack Management** ‚Üí **Data Views**.
   - Click **Create data view**.
   - Enter your index pattern (e.g., `person*` to match all indices starting with "person").
   - Complete the setup.

2. **Explore Your Data**  
   - Navigate to **Discover** in Kibana.
   - Select your newly created data view.
   - You can now browse and search all documents related to your chosen index or pattern.
